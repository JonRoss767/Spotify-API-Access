# Spotify-API-Access
This is a simple example of accessing Spotify API using Flask. 
This example will get a users access token and will refresh the token as needed. This example as of now only gets a users saved tracks and albums,
but could easily expand its functionality. 

For me, this was a test that will later be applied to a full stack project using React.
